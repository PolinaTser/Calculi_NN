The folder "training" contains two projects where models PCA+Catboost and PARAFAC+RF are trained. The folder 'preprocessing' contains examples of spectral data preprocessing.

This study examines the application of diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) and fluorescence spectroscopy for real-time assessment during laser lithotripsy to analyze the structural composition of kidney stones. Traditional analytical methods are ineffective for in situ studies; therefore, the focus is on optical methods that can be integrated into the laser system. Experiments were conducted on ex vivo samples using DRS and fluorescence spectroscopy (utilizing excitation-emission matrices) to analyze the composition of 120 stones. Two regression models were constructed to predict the relative concentration of substances in the concretion. The study showed that the model using the PARAFAC method combined with random forest (RF) outperforms the PCA and CatBoost-based model. On the test sample, the average error of the PARAFAC+RF model was 21%, whereas for PCA+CatBoost it was 22%. Additionally, the prediction accuracy of the model for urate concentration, which was 7%, is comparable to the clinical accuracy of the IR spectroscopy method, confirming its practical applicability.
